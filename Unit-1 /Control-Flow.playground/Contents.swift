 block of code - {code in here}
 
 if (some condition is true) {
 execute this block of code

 this block of code gets executed if the if condition is false

 //   EXAMPLES
 
 example 1
 if(some condition is true) [
 execute code
 }
 other code runs normal
 
 // example 2 - if/else statement
 if(some condition is true) {
 execute this block of code
 } else {
 some othe rstatement will get executed
 }
 other code runs as normal
 
 //example 3 - if/else if/else
