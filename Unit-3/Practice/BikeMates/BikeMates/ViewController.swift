   // Chelsi wants to sleep for at least an hour with out any one down here. She's been trying to get him upstairs and I appreciate it. Honestly he's just being childish in my opinion but you know that's neither here nor there cuz it's not my man. This isn't my house and "I'm worth it", however I respect that this isn't my house. He lives here. Do ya work sis. not my business. Be respectful, fully acknowledge him as a human being, and do your work.
